# mariana_final_project


This is my final project. It is a ML model to predict fetal health, based on CTG scans.

This is a project for my Data Analytics Bootcamp at IronHack, which I built using some skills developeded through the bootcamp.

It is a predictive model of Fetal Health based on CTG scans.
Fetal monitoring is important to prevent baby and mother's complications throughout the course of childbirth.

I got a database of CTG's already classified, cleaned and prepared the data in Python and tried maaaany machine learning models.

My choice went for a random forest model with randomized search with cross-validation and I achieved a F1 score of 94%.

I built a streamlit app to make it easier to use, where you can also find some context for the project, the process and The Model.

Contact me if you have doubts or suggestions.
